# Move By Move (Draughts)
This starts as an exercise of working on projects step-by-step: instead of setting a big goal and stopping midway, goals for this project will be in short steps. This allows any amount of changing plans and architecture, as well is being more fun. Planning ahead is still a thing, but that is not the focus.

To look at the goals look up [issues by label 'generation'](https://github.com/niqzart/move-by-move/issues?q=label%3Ageneration)
